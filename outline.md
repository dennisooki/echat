**I. Project Setup and Dependencies**

1. **Environment:**
   - Set up a Python development environment using tools like Anaconda or virtualenv ([https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)).
   - Install required libraries:
     - `tkinter` or other GUI toolkit (e.g., `PyQt`, `wxPython`) for the graphical user interface.
     - `socket` for TCP communication.
     - `ssl` for TLS/SSL encryption.
     - `cryptography` (optional, recommended for more advanced cryptography)
     - `hashlib` for password hashing.
     - `threading` or `asyncio` for concurrent message handling (scalability).

**II. User Authentication and Access Control**

1. **User Database Design:**
   - Choose a database solution (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) based on project scale and preferences.
   - Design a schema with fields for username, password hash, and (optional) access level.

2. **Password Security:**
   - Implement secure password hashing using bcrypt or another strong hashing algorithm with random salts.
   - Avoid storing plain text passwords.

3. **Registration:**
   - Create a registration form in the GUI to collect username and password.
   - Validate username uniqueness and password strength.
   - Hash the password and store it along with the username in the database.

4. **Login:**
   - Implement a login form in the GUI for users to enter their credentials.
   - Fetch the user's password hash from the database.
   - Verify the entered password against the hashed value using the chosen hashing algorithm.
   - Upon successful login, generate a session token (e.g., JWT) for authentication on the server-side (if applicable).

5. **Access Control (Optional):**
   - Define access levels for different user roles (e.g., administrator, moderator, regular user).
   - Store access levels in the user database (or use an external authorization server).
   - Implement logic to restrict certain actions or features based on user roles on the server-side.

**III. GUI Design and Functionality**

1. **Main Window:**
   - Design the main GUI window using your chosen toolkit.
   - Include elements for:
     - User list (to display connected users).
     - Chat conversation area (to show messages).
     - Message input field (for typing messages).
     - Send button (to send messages).
     - Optional logout button.

2. **Message Sending/Receiving:**
   - On the client-side, create a TCP socket that connects to the server.
   - Implement secure communication using SSL/TLS context:
     - Use `ssl.wrap_socket` to wrap the TCP socket and establish a secure connection.
   - Upon sending a message:
     - Encrypt the message content using the chosen encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) within the secure connection.
     - Send the encrypted message to the server.
   - Upon receiving a message:
     - Decrypt the message content using the same algorithm.
     - Display the decrypted message in the chat conversation area.

3. **Concurrent Communication (Scalability):**
   - For handling multiple connections and messages efficiently, consider using:
     - Multithreading (`threading`) for basic concurrency (be mindful of the Global Interpreter Lock - GIL).
     - Asynchronous programming (`asyncio`) for more advanced concurrency, especially when dealing with network I/O.
     - Implement event-driven architecture or thread pools for better scalability.

**IV. Server-Side Development (Optional)**

1. **Server Application:**
   - Choose a Python server framework (e.g., Flask, Django) or create a custom server script.
   - Implement logic for:
     - Accepting TCP connections from clients.
     - Establishing secure connections using SSL/TLS context.
     - User authentication and authorization based on received credentials or session tokens.
     - Handling message sending/receiving (encrypting/decrypting messages on the server side if applicable).
     - Broadcasting messages to connected clients.

2. **Client-Server Communication Protocol (Optional):**
   - Define a message format (e.g., JSON) for sending and receiving messages between client and server.
   - Include fields for:
     - Sender username (optional, if usernames are displayed).
     - Message content.
     - (Optional) Additional metadata (e.g., timestamps, message type).

**V. Testing and Deployment**

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., authentication, encryption
